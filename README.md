The retail sales team struggled with limited visibility into:



📉 Fluctuating product sales trends



❌ Identifying top vs. underperforming brands



🌍 Regional sales distribution



📦 Monitoring stock and demand alignment



Without a centralized dashboard, decision-making was reactive instead of strategic.

Fields include: Date, Region, Product/Brand, Quantity Sold, Revenue



Pre-cleaned and modeled inside Power BI
